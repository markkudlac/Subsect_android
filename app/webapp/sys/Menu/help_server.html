<h3>Intro</h3>
<div class="bigtext" >
    <p>
        This is alpha software and assumes that the current group of users will be tolerant of rough edges
        in all aspects of this product. There are a number of limitations in this software that need to be
        addressed. As this is an open source project you may be the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Subsect uses the WebRTC protocol and the hosted sites can only be accessed by a browser that
        supports WebRTC data channel. This would include more recent versions of Chrome, Firefox,
        and Opera on desk/lap tops including OSX or Android. There is no browser support on iOS.
    </p>

</div>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<div class="bigtext" >
    <p>
        Upon installing the app the <em>Administration</em> page opens. Host Name is the unique server name which
        will be your subdomain, <i>yourhostname</i>.<b>subsect.net</b>. This will become the host part of your
        sites URLs'. It is 4 - 20
        lower case alphanumeric characters long. A password is required which is 4 - 20
        upper/lower case alphanumeric (plus _ ) characters long. Email is optional and is currently not used but
        is planned to be for contacting hosts if needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the host name is submitted and accepted it can not currently be updated. The password and email can be
        changed. This can only be done through the app and on the device the server is running on.
        You do not need to know the current password to change it.
    </p>
    <p>
        On exiting <em>Administration</em> to the Subsect Server main page the server should start within a few seconds.
        The server is running when the <b>Start/Stop</b> button is labled <b>Stop</b> and the start date time is to he right of it.
        If it is not running close the app out with the task switcher and relaunch it. Tapping <b>Stop</b> will stop the
        server sites on the device will not be reachable. Tap <b>Start</b> to restart the server. Always stop the
        server before exiting the app so users will be alerted the erver is not available.
    </p>
    <p>
        The log button to the right shows a console screen which dumps some debug currently.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Bazaar</h3>
<div class="bigtext" >
    <p>
        With the server running it is now time to load a site. Subsect has the equivalent of an "App/Play Store"
        which is called the <em>Bazaar</em>. It is early days in thee Bazaar with minimal functionality. After selecting
        the <em>Bazaar</em> option from the menu a list of available sites/services should appear. It is recommend
        that the <b>TestSite</b> be installed first. Tap the icon and accept install. This should only take a few
        seconds. After install completes return to main page and select <em>Installed</em> from Menu. TestSite
        should be listed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If all is good, open an WebRTC compliant browser and enter the url <em>yourhostname</em>.<b>subsect.net</b> .
        A page with the tile <b>Menu</b> should open and TestSite should show. Tap/click item and it should
        open the site installed on your device. Try to add/edit a name entry. TestSite is largely just to confirm
        your server/database is operational.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<div class="bigtext" >
    <p>
        <b>Before using any tools STOP the server.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>Tools</em> menu option supports four functions. EXPORT allows an individual site to be packaged
        for installation on another device or for backup. No data is exported only site logic and resources.
        Select from the list of current packages then tap EXPORT.
        IMPORT is the opposite. This is largely to support a side loading type function.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>!! After using EXPORT or BACKUP DB you must close Subsect with the task manager
            and relaunch before doing any other operations !!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can download/upload the export
        using the the appropriate option in the <b>Menu</b> page when you access <em>yourhostname</em>.<b>subsect.net</b> in
        the browser.
        You will need to login in Menu (in browser) to get these options. The password is the one setup in
        <em>Administration</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        BACKUP DB and RESTORE DB allow for the backup and export of datafiles. The BACKUP DB function will coppy
        the DB of each installed site and make a tar of all into one file. Again download to the browser using the
        <b>Menu</b> page. When uploading and downloading your browsing device needs to be on the same network (WiFi router
        for example) as your Android device. You can use the browser on your device to download and then
        copy that off as this is always on the same network.
    </p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<div class="bigtext" >
    <p>
        The options here are for using an alternative connection server. If developing a site it is more convenient
        to use a local server. The setup of a development environment is beyond the scope of this help. Just keep
        the "Connection Server : subsect.net" option checked.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>Other</h3>
<div class="bigtext" >
    <p>
        To remove an installed site, go to the <em>Installed</em> menu option and tap the "Remove"
        button next to the icon the site to be removed. All data associated with this site will also be removed.
        After removing a package it is recommended that the server be closed and
        the <b>Subsect app closed with the task manager</b> and then restarted.
    </p>
